## FAQ

### Is this a Production Grade Chat Application?

No. This Application was created so that I could better understand how Public Key Cryptography Works

### Is this the only way to create an End to End Encryption Chat Application?

Ofcourse Not! There probably are much better ways to do so, but this is how I did it. There aren't much information on creating such appliation available online so this is One of many ways to do so.

## Note

You can play with the code as much as you want. The only thing I discourage is cloning the repository and distributing the project as a college assignment of anykind
